## It is important to have and keep a growth mindset. For me having a growth mindset means to not let your struggles stop you but to use them as a motivation to push yourself further. Never give up even when you find hardships blocking your path.
 
### Three reminder I use to keep myself in a growth mindset:
### 1. I constantly remind myself no matter how hard things get to keep pushing.
### 2. I think about how I can better myself in the future by pushing forward.
### 3. I think about the people I look up to and the way they use a growth mindset.
